# limited-concurrency-worker-js

A library that provides a limited number of concurrent workers for JavaScript/Typescript.

## Motivation

In JavaScript, if it needs to run the async functions parallelly with a restriction of the number of concurrent workers, the code has to be a little idiomatic. This library provides some wrappers for that purpose by using the Generator, for easiness, for simpleness.
